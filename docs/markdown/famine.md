# Literature on Famine

In order to analyse the adjusment mechanism to price disequilibria, three families of dynamic models have been used in the literature : error-correction models, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, and agent-based models.

## 1. Models for price adjustment during crisis

### 1.1. Error correction model and adjustments to diequilibria ( Ó Gráda, 2015 )

Ó Gráda (2015) uses the error corection model approach to test whether the reaction to emerging disequilibria was slower during a crisis than in normal times. He estimates the following simple representation of the error correction model (ECM) :

$$
\Delta \text{P}_{i,t} = a + b \Delta \text{P}_{A,t} + c \text{FAM1} + d \text{P}_{i,t-1} + e \text{P}_{A, t-1} + f \text{FAM2} + g \text{FAM3} + \text{u}'_{it}
$$
where 
$$
\text{FAM1} = \text{FAMDUM}.\Delta \text{P}_{A,t}  \\
\text{FAM2} = \text{FAMDUM}.\text{P}_{i,t-1}  \\
\text{FAM3} = \text{FAMDUM}.\text{P}_{A',t-1}  
$$

Here $\text{P}$ is the natural log of price, $\text{A}$ is Region A, and $i$ is any other region. Agents adjust $ \text{P}_{i,t} $ from $ \text{P}_{i,t-1} $, in response to changes in $ \text{P}_{A} $ (with b measuring the short-run effect).

Changes to $ \text{P}_{i} $ are caused by by shocks to $ \text{P}_{A} $ with a long-run relation $ \text{P}_{i} = (e/d) P_A $ (mistake? should this not be -(e/d) ?)

Main findings :

1. The author finds that the $b$ coefficients are all positive and the $d$ coefficients are all negative.
2. The spread of coefficient values is consistent with distance and communications - the closer the markets to each other , the bigger the coefficients - or the stronger the co-movements and the bigger the adjustments to disequilibria
3. The $c$s are mostly positive. There are stronger co-movements during the famine months. Most of the $f$s are negative indicating faster adjustment in crisis months. 
4. Reaction to wheat prices in 1709-10 was somewhat stronger than in 1693-94. 


### 1.2. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models

DSGE models build on the assumption of a representative agent operationg under rational expectations in a general equilibrium.

Over the past three decades economists have modified the basic DSGE model in order analyse crisis dynamics and price adjustment, mainly by introducing frictions and non-linearities.

Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) use the financial aggregator which amplifies initial shocks, making a small economic downturn propagate into a credit crunch and a large recession. The external finance premium creates a wedge between the cost of internal and external funds, which widens during a crisis and affects firm investment and demand, slowing down price adjustment.

Gertler and Karadi (2011) introduce intermediary frictions and focus on a financial intermediary/banking sector subject to moral hazard or capital constraints. A financial shock causes intermediaries' net worth to fall, which in turn reduces their capacity to lend and amplifies the transmission of shocks to the real economy.

Since the financial crisis of 2008, DSGE models have been relying on occasionally binding constraints (or Zero Lower Bound) by incorporating non-linearities like a minimum regulatory capital requirement for banks or a collateral constraint for households (e.g., loan-to-value ratio). When the constraint binds (during a crisis), the dynamics change abruptly, often leading to a sharper price or output response (see for instance Gust et al., 2017). 

Another approach to modify the price adjustment mechanism has been to replace the standard Calvo pricing or the Rotemberg pricing by alternatives. 

For instance within the state-dependent price setting firms adjust prices based on how far their price is from the optimal level, which becomes more costly during a crisis. This introduces non-linearity into the New Keynesian Phillips Curve. In this setup firms respond more quickly to large disequilibrium, which can be relevant during a crisis.

Another approach is to introduce inflation-based adjustment costs. Here we introduce costs that depend not just on the level of price change, but also on the first difference of inflation ( $ \pi_t - \pi_{t-1} $ ​). This generates more inflation persistence and helps the model fit empirical data, especially during periods of high volatility. In other words, costs arise from changes in the inflation rate, which better captures inertial or volatile price-setting in crisis.

Finally, by introducing Markov-Switching into a DSGE model, one allows key parameters (like expectation rules, monetary policy rule coefficients, or price-stickiness) to switch between regimes (e.g., "normal" vs. "crisis"). For price adjustment, this can model a shift from rational to adaptive expectations (simple learning) during the crisis regime, which slows down price adjustment. The transition probability between regimes is governed by a Markov process, capturing shifts in behavior or policy.


### 1.3. Heterogeneous Agent Models (HAM)

Kaplan et al. (2018) develops a quantitative HANK model to show that monetary policy's transmission mechanism works mostly through indirect general equilibrium effects on household income, not the direct intertemporal substitution channel of standard models. It highlights the importance of heterogeneous marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) and "hand-to-mouth" households.

Auclert et al. (2025) demonstrate that the size of the fiscal multiplier is significantly larger than in Representative Agent New Keynesian models, primarily because government spending generates income for constrained, high-MPC households.

Bilbiie (2020) provides an analytically tractable (simplified) HANK model. It clearly illustrates the mechanism of the "New Keynesian Cross" (the interaction between household heterogeneity and nominal rigidity) and shows how HANK models can address several puzzles of the RANK literature, such as the forward guidance puzzle, and generate amplification.



### 1.4. Agent-Based Models (ABM)

In the _market microstructure mechanism_, the Limit Order Book (LOB) Dynamics is a mechanism used in crisis ABMs. Agents (liquidity demanders, suppliers, and market makers) submit limit orders (to buy/sell at a specific price) and market orders (to trade immediately at the best available price). The transaction price is determined endogenously where supply and demand meet.

In this framework, a crisis is modeled as a shock that reduces market maker capacity (e.g., due to balance sheet constraints or increased risk) and increases liquidity demanders' need for immediacy (e.g., forced selling due to margin calls or redemptions). This micro-level imbalance — a lack of limit orders to absorb selling pressure — leads to cascades of falling prices and a sharp increase in the bid-ask spread (a measure of illiquidity), which is the emergent price adjustment during a crisis.

Price dynamics are influenced by the difference in the timing and urgency of trades between different agent types. During a crisis, liquidity demanders (forced sellers) exhibit greater immediacy and push prices down more aggressively than the slow-to-react liquidity suppliers or constrained market makers. 

In _macroeconomic AMBs_ there are several mechanims that are used.

The asymmetric price adjustment mechanism captures the observation that during the 2008 crisis, financially constrained firms often raised prices while healthy firms cut them. Firms with weak balance sheets (limited internal liquidity, high leverage) are modeled to find it optimal to raise prices to boost current cash flows, even at the cost of losing future market share. This is an attempt to avoid costly external financing or maintain liquidity. Conversely, financially stronger firms may cut prices to gain market share. This heterogeneity in response to a negative demand/financial shock results in an overall attenuation of deflationary pressure compared to standard models, where prices would simply fall.

The adaptive heuristics and social interaction assumtion, uses simplified heuristics (rules of thumb) instead of full optimization, and they learn or imitate the pricing strategies of other successful agents. During a crisis, this can introduce price stickiness or volatility. Firms are often modeled to choose one of a few discrete pricing strategies (e.g., lower, maintain, or raise price) based on their utility function, which includes both private (e.g., profit margin) and social features (e.g., observing neighbors' price changes). The fear of making a mistake or menu costs can lead to stickiness, where firms only adjust prices when the deviation from their target price (price misalignment) is sufficiently large, or when the economic outlook is extremely uncertain (crisis).
