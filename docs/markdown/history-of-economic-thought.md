# History of Economic Thought


## Classical (late 18th century)

The big events of that period were :
- America (1776)
- Mercantist economic policies of the British state : laissez-faire and free trade
- French state is bankrupt (1789)
- Industrial Revolution in Britain (1760-1832) : industrial capitalists vs. merchants
- Adam Smith (1776) :  laissez-faire, the virtues of specialization, free trade and competition
- Jean-Baptiste Say (1803) : wanted to take the field of _political economy_ back towards the French demand-and-supply tradition
- Robert Malthus (1798, 1820) : wanted to add a whole new emphasis, away from the obsessive intricacies of "value" and towards a more macroeconomic (and "dynamic") perspective
- David Ricardo (1817) : wanted to do Smith all over again, but to do it properly this time


### Adam Smith : _Wealth of Nations_


### Robert Malthus (1798) :  _Essay on Population_

- axiom : natural population growth exceeds economic growth
- "wage-fertility" dynamic : any increases in per capita income will only induce an increase in population which will dilute it completely
- attempts to improve the lot of the poor are ultimately self-defeating

### David Ricardo (1817) : _Principles of Political Economy and Taxation_ 

- fundamental treatise of the Classical School
- prices are independent of income distribution
- "labor-embodied" theory of value
- prices (in the long-run) are purely determined by labor costs, measured not in terms of money (i.e. wages x labor hours), but in actual physical terms (labor hours alone)
- theory of "comparative advantage" : arguing that so long as nations specialize in goods which they have a lower comparative  (not absolute) cost in producing, there are always mutual gains to be made from trade
- **advocacy of free trade** would became a fundamental policy position for the Classical school
- "Classical Ricardian" School : trio of true disciples  with James Mill (1821),  John Ramsay McCulloch (1824 and elsewhere), and Thomas de Quincey (1823, 1824)
